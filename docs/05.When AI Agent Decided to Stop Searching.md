# When AI Agent Decided to Stop Searching

Looking at the logs and configuration for scenarios 2 and 3, here are the possible reasons why the LLM was only called 2 times instead of the maximum 3 iterations:

## **1. Early Stopping Threshold Met**

**Scenario 2:**
- Early Stop Threshold: **8**
- Max Iterations: **3**
- From the output: Found viable options in iteration 1, likely reached the threshold

**Scenario 3:**
- Early Stop Threshold: **5**
- Max Iterations: **3**
- From the output: Found 1 viable option in iteration 1

The early stopping logic in `ai_agent.py:303-319` shows:
```python
def _apply_early_stopping(self, decision: IterationDecision) -> IterationDecision:
    threshold = int(self._config.get("early_stopping_threshold", 0) or 0)
    if threshold <= 0:
        return decision

    count = len(decision.viable_options)
    if decision.continue_search and count >= threshold:
        # Force stop and override continue_search to False
        return IterationDecision(continue_search=False, ...)
```

## **2. AI Agent Decided to Stop Searching**

From the logs, both scenarios show AI reasoning that suggests stopping:

**Scenario 2:**
> "However, the options identified can be utilized to mitigate immediate needs while pursuing additional sourcing."

**Scenario 3:**
> "Given the aggressive scenario posture, we recommend pursuing additional supplier outreach to cover the remaining shortfall"

The AI agent returned `continue_search=False` in the iteration decision, ending the search loop.

## **3. No Additional Inventory Found**

**Scenario 2 log line 27:**
> "No inventory options returned for this iteration."

This suggests that after the first iteration, the database query didn't return additional viable inventory options, so there was nothing new for the AI to evaluate.

## **4. Call Pattern Analysis**

The actual call pattern is:
1. **Call 1:** `POST /v1/responses` - Iteration evaluation (analyzes found inventory)
2. **Call 2:** `POST /v1/responses` - Final recommendation (consolidates all results)

The system **doesn't call the LLM for empty iterations** - if no new inventory is found, it skips directly to the final recommendation phase.

## **Most Likely Reason**

**Scenario 2 & 3 both stopped after 1 iteration** because:
1. The initial database search found some viable options
2. The AI evaluated them and decided the search could stop (either due to early stopping threshold or strategic decision)
3. No subsequent iterations were needed, so only 2 LLM calls total: 1 iteration + 1 final recommendation

This is **efficient behavior** - the system doesn't waste LLM calls on iterations that won't provide additional value.
