# Enhanced Scenario 3 LLM Call Example

## Scenario: Metropolitan Infrastructure Collapse - Major Earthquake
**Context**: 7.2 magnitude earthquake affecting 2M people in Sydney metropolitan area requiring executive-level resource allocation decisions

---

## SINGLE ITERATION CALL (High-Stakes Executive Decision)

### System Prompt
```
You are the emergency accommodation AI coordinator for T2.
Evaluate failed shipment impacts and recommend accommodations with clear business justification.
Prioritize transparency, cite key constraints, and provide an executive-ready summary.

Scenario posture: Aggressive.
Favor rapid recovery and expanded supplier outreach even if approvals are complex.
Highlight bold trade-offs and stop searching once decisive coverage is identified.

CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE EXPERTISE:
- Heavy Rescue Equipment: Consider deployment speed, operator certification, terrain accessibility
- Medical Surge Supplies: Factor in trauma capacity, surgical requirements, blood supply chain
- Power Generation: Account for grid restoration timeline, hospital priority, fuel logistics
- Water Treatment: Balance potability standards vs speed of deployment, distribution network
- Communications: Ensure emergency service interoperability, civilian alert capability, backup power

EXECUTIVE DECISION CRITERIA:
- Lives at immediate risk supersede all other considerations
- Budget constraints suspended for first 72 hours of major incident response
- Political implications of resource displacement must be documented but not determinative
- International aid coordination may require diplomatic clearance

Always respond using the structured schema provided.

## Key Scenario 3 Distinctive Features

### **Executive-Level Complexity**
- **National security implications**: Communications backup displacement
- **International commitments**: Pacific aid delivery delays
- **Multi-state coordination**: 4 states affected by resource displacement
- **Budget scale**: $47M in downstream program impacts

### **Aggressive Decision-Making**
- **Life safety priority**: "2M population at risk" overrides other considerations
- **Complex trade-offs**: International diplomacy vs immediate rescue capability
- **High-confidence recommendations**: 0.90-0.98 confidence despite complexity
- **Strategic risk acceptance**: 365-day recovery timelines accepted for critical assets

### **Sophisticated Impact Assessment**
- **Cascading effects**: State emergency preparedness gaps
- **Recovery timelines**: 30-365 days across different programs
- **Geographic logistics**: Cross-continental transport calculations
- **Political considerations**: PM&C briefing requirements

### **Executive Communication Style**
- **Dollar quantification**: $47M impact figure
- **Diplomatic implications**: Pacific nations notification
- **Implementation sequencing**: Medical → USAR → Power → Communications
- **Governance structures**: 24/7 executive coordination cell

This example demonstrates how enhanced Scenario 3 creates the most sophisticated and realistic demonstration of high-stakes emergency management decision-making, suitable for executive-level stakeholders and complex organizational scenarios.
