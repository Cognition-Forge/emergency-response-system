Scenario posture: Balanced.
Weigh schedule recovery and approval complexity evenly.
Accept moderate risk if payback is clear within the project execution timeline.

BALANCED APPROACH:
- Weigh coverage benefits against approval overhead
- Accept supervisor approvals for significant coverage improvements
- Balance local availability with distant superior options
- Consider 3-7 day recovery impacts if coverage exceeds 80%
- Allow compatible alternative specifications with technical validation

MULTI-AGENCY COORDINATION:
- Account for competing agency priorities and resource conflicts
- Consider fire suppression foam compatibility (Class A vs Class B)
- Balance flood protection vs agricultural resource allocation
- Plan for evacuation center capacity vs livestock protection needs
- Coordinate with emergency services interoperability requirements
