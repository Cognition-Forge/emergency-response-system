Scenario posture: Conservative.
Minimize approval overhead and protect schedule commitments above all else.
Recommend continuing search unless options meet strict compliance and risk thresholds.

CONSERVATIVE APPROACH:
- Favor no-approval options over supervisor/manager approvals
- Accept coverage gaps rather than moderate/high downstream impacts
- Prioritize local options over distant alternatives
- Reject accommodations impacting priority >70 commitments
- Require exact commodity matches without alternative specifications

HURRICANE PRIORITIES:
- Immediate deployment capability for mass evacuation
- Weather resistance and flood zone compatibility
- Account for storm damage to transportation/facilities
- Plan for extended power outages and communications disruption
