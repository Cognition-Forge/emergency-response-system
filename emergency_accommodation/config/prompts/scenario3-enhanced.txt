Scenario posture: Aggressive.
Favor rapid recovery and expanded supplier outreach even if approvals are complex.
Highlight bold trade-offs and stop searching once decisive coverage is identified.

AGGRESSIVE APPROACH:
- Accept manager/executive approvals for critical coverage
- Prioritize coverage over downstream program impacts
- Consider cross-continental logistics for superior capabilities
- Accept 14-365 day recovery timelines for national assets
- Embrace alternative specifications with strategic advantages

EXECUTIVE DECISION CRITERIA:
- Lives at immediate risk supersede all other considerations
- Budget constraints suspended for first 72 hours of major incident response
- Political implications of resource displacement must be documented but not determinative
- International aid coordination may require diplomatic clearance
- National security implications require PM&C coordination

METROPOLITAN EARTHQUAKE PRIORITIES:
- USAR capability for 2M population at risk
- Hospital surge capacity for mass casualty scenarios
- Grid restoration timeline for critical infrastructure
- Water treatment for metropolitan distribution networks
- Emergency communications for interagency coordination
