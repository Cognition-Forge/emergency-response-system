# FEAT Requirements: Emergency Response Python CLI Application

## Business Context

The T2 emergency accommodation system requires a professional application that showcases AI-driven decision-making for supply chain disruptions. When critical materials shipments fail due to accidents, weather, or supplier issues, project teams need rapid accommodation solutions that minimize schedule impact while considering existing commitments and approval requirements.

This Python CLI application (`emergency_accommodation`) will demonstrate the complete emergency response workflow using the existing PostgreSQL database with three realistic scenarios, emphasizing iterative discovery and configurable AI-driven analysis rather than rigid mathematical scoring.

## User Stories

### US-001: Emergency Coordinator Analysis
**As an** Emergency Response Coordinator
**I want to** analyze failed SCN shipments and find accommodation options through iterative search
**So that** I can quickly identify viable alternatives while understanding their business impact

### US-002: Configurable Search Strategy
**As a** Project Manager
**I want to** configure search parameters, AI decision criteria, and prompt templates through config files
**So that** different emergency situations can be handled with appropriate risk tolerance and approval thresholds without code changes

### US-003: AI-Driven Accommodation Decisions
**As an** Emergency Coordinator
**I want the** AI to evaluate inventory options and provide business justification
**So that** I can understand trade-offs and get executive summaries for approval workflows

### US-004: Iterative Discovery Process
**As a** Database Administrator
**I want to** limit database queries through incremental loading (weekly/monthly batches)
**So that** the system remains performant and doesn't overload the PostgreSQL server

### US-005: Professional Demonstration Output
**As a** Stakeholder
**I want to** see professional CLI output with clear accommodation recommendations
**So that** I can understand the system's capabilities for emergency response scenarios

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-001: Scenario Execution
- **GIVEN** the PostgreSQL database is running with scenario data loaded
- **WHEN** I execute `python main.py --scenario scenario1`
- **THEN** the system performs iterative search and displays accommodation options with AI analysis

### AC-002: File-Based Configuration
- **GIVEN** configuration files for search parameters and AI prompts in `config/` directory
- **WHEN** I run scenarios 1, 2, and 3
- **THEN** each uses scenario-specific parameters and prompt templates loaded from config files

### AC-003: Iterative Database Loading
- **GIVEN** failed SCN items are identified
- **WHEN** the system searches for accommodations
- **THEN** it loads inventory data incrementally (max 3 iterations) with configurable batch sizes

### AC-004: AI Decision Making
- **GIVEN** inventory options are found in each iteration
- **WHEN** the AI agent evaluates them
- **THEN** it decides whether to continue searching and provides ranked recommendations with business justification

### AC-005: Early Stopping Logic
- **GIVEN** the AI finds sufficient viable options (configurable threshold)
- **WHEN** evaluating an iteration
- **THEN** it stops searching early and proceeds to final recommendation

### AC-006: Rich CLI Output
- **GIVEN** accommodation analysis is complete
- **WHEN** displaying results
- **THEN** output includes color-coded impact levels, progress indicators, and structured recommendation details

### AC-007: Database Integration
- **GIVEN** the existing PostgreSQL database with emergency accommodation schema
- **WHEN** connecting to the database
- **THEN** the system uses async connection pooling and executes scenario-specific queries

### AC-008: OpenAI Agent Integration
- **GIVEN** OpenAI API credentials are configured and prompt templates are loaded from config files
- **WHEN** the AI agent evaluates accommodation options
- **THEN** it uses configurable prompt templates with scenario-specific business context from file-based configuration

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Database queries must use async/await with connection pooling
- Incremental loading limited to 3 iterations maximum with configurable batch sizes (default: 10 records per iteration)
- Early stopping when viable options threshold reached (default: 5 options)
- Response time under 30 seconds for complete scenario analysis

### Security
- OpenAI API keys stored in environment variables, never in code
- Database credentials managed through environment configuration
- No sensitive data logged or exposed in CLI output

### Usability
- Professional CLI interface with rich formatting and progress indicators
- Clear error messages for configuration issues or database connectivity problems
- All configurable parameters (search settings, AI prompts) accessible through config files without code changes
- Self-documenting output suitable for stakeholder demonstrations

### Maintainability
- Streamlined architecture with clear separation of concerns (database, AI, configuration, output)
- Type hints throughout codebase following Python professional standards
- Simple error handling with clear messages
- File-based configuration system to support different deployment scenarios and prompt modifications

### Integration
- Compatible with existing PostgreSQL database schema from FEAT-001
- Leverages existing scenario data (scenario1, scenario2, scenario3)
- Uses OpenAI Agents SDK for AI integration
- Follows Python professional development guidelines with `uv` dependency management via `pyproject.toml`

### Scalability
- Async/await architecture supports concurrent database operations
- Configurable iteration limits prevent database overload
- Memory-efficient incremental data loading
- File-based configuration system for easy addition of new scenarios or search strategies
