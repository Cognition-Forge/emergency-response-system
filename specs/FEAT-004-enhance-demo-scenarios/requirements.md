# FEAT Requirements: Enhance Demo Scenarios with Option A

## Business Context
Current demo scenarios use unrealistic scale (20-60 items, single commodities) that fails to showcase system capabilities to stakeholders. Option A enhancement creates realistic emergency response demonstrations through multi-commodity diversity, appropriate scale (500-5000 items), and geographic distribution without code changes.

## User Stories

### US-001: Realistic Scale Demonstration
**As an** executive stakeholder
**I want** scenarios representing actual disaster scale (thousands of items across multiple commodity types)
**So that** I can evaluate real-world system applicability

### US-002: Multi-Commodity Decision Making
**As an** emergency coordinator
**I want** AI recommendations across shelter, medical, power, water, and communications commodities
**So that** I can assess complex multi-faceted emergency handling

### US-003: Geographic Logistics Analysis
**As a** logistics coordinator
**I want** accommodation options across multiple warehouses with distance calculations
**So that** I can evaluate transportation and deployment feasibility

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-001: Enhanced Scale
- **GIVEN** any enhanced scenario **WHEN** loaded **THEN** contains 500-5000 items across 5+ commodity categories

### AC-002: Multi-Warehouse Coverage
- **GIVEN** inventory search **WHEN** executed **THEN** returns options from 3+ warehouses with geographic distribution

### AC-003: Sophisticated AI Reasoning
- **GIVEN** enhanced prompts and data **WHEN** AI evaluates **THEN** demonstrates commodity expertise, coverage gaps, and geographic trade-offs

### AC-004: Realistic Coverage Scenarios
- **GIVEN** enhanced scale **WHEN** analysis performed **THEN** shows partial coverage requiring multiple accommodations (e.g., 64% shelter coverage)

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Enhanced scenarios load <5s, AI analysis <45s
- **Data Integrity**: Maintain existing UUID patterns and validation
- **Implementation**: Data and prompt enhancements only - no code changes
- **Demonstration**: Measurably improved stakeholder engagement through realistic complexity
